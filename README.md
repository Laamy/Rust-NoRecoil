# Rust-NoRecoil
Rust NoRecoil (Use at your own risk)

I made this for educational purposes and will not be updating it
do not cry in issues that it doesnt work or shows up as a virus as i really dont care

I made this because i got curious on how well a script could adjust for the random recoil without scanning the screen
